# Milestone 1: Statistical Modeling - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Milestone 1 has been successfully implemented! The system now includes a complete machine learning pipeline for recommending comparable properties using statistical modeling approaches.

## What Was Built

### 1. Feature Engineering Pipeline
**File**: [src/utils/feature_engineering.py](src/utils/feature_engineering.py)

- **18 Features Extracted** per property:
  - Basic: GLA, bedrooms, bathrooms, room count, age, DOM (days on market)
  - Distance: Distance to subject property
  - Price: Sale price
  - Categorical: Condition, location similarity, property type, stories
  - Comparison: GLA difference/ratio, bedroom difference, age difference

- **Functions**:
  - `extract_property_features()` - Extract features from property dict
  - `create_feature_matrix()` - Build feature matrix from property list
  - `normalize_features()` - Normalize features to 0-1 range
  - `parse_distance()` - Parse distance strings (KM, M)
  - `extract_numeric()` - Extract numbers from strings

### 2. Recommendation Models
**File**: [src/models/recommender.py](src/models/recommender.py)

#### **KNN Recommender**
- Uses K-Nearest Neighbors to find similar properties
- Configurable distance metrics (euclidean, manhattan, cosine)
- Ranks by feature similarity to subject property

#### **Cluster Recommender**
- Groups properties into clusters using K-Means
- Recommends from the same cluster as subject
- Scores by distance to cluster center

#### **Hybrid Recommender** ⭐
- Combines KNN and clustering approaches
- Weighted scoring (default: 60% KNN, 40% clustering)
- Best of both worlds: similarity + grouping

### 3. Evaluation Framework
**File**: [src/models/evaluation.py](src/models/evaluation.py)

**Metrics Implemented**:
- **Precision@K** - Fraction of recommended items that are relevant
- **Recall@K** - Fraction of relevant items that are recommended
- **F1@K** - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **NDCG@K** - Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
- **Average Precision** - Average precision across all relevant items
- **MAP** - Mean Average Precision across all appraisals
- **MRR** - Mean Reciprocal Rank
- **Hit Rate** - At least one relevant item recommended

**Evaluator Class**:
- `RecommenderEvaluator` - Comprehensive evaluation pipeline
- `compare_models()` - Compare multiple models side-by-side
- Pretty printing and DataFrame export

### 4. Training Pipeline
**File**: [src/models/train.py](src/models/train.py)

**Features**:
- Automatic train/test split (default: 80/20)
- Trains all 3 models simultaneously
- Evaluates on held-out test set
- Saves models to `models/` directory
- Model comparison and reporting

**Output**:
- `knn_recommender.pkl`
- `clustering_recommender.pkl`
- `hybrid_recommender.pkl`

### 5. Prediction Interface
**File**: [src/models/predict.py](src/models/predict.py)

**Functions**:
- `load_model()` - Load trained model from disk
- `predict_comps()` - Recommend comps for subject property
- `predict_for_appraisal()` - End-to-end prediction with display
- `predict_from_json()` - Predict from JSON file
- `format_recommendation()` - Pretty print recommendations

### 6. Updated CLI
**File**: [run.py](run.py)

**New Commands**:
```bash
# Train all models
python run.py train

# Make predictions
python run.py predict
python run.py predict --model knn
python run.py predict --model clustering
python run.py predict --index 10

# Evaluate models
python run.py evaluate
```

## How to Use

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Train models (first time only)
python run.py train

# 2. Make predictions
python run.py predict

# 3. Try different models
python run.py predict --model knn
python run.py predict --model clustering
python run.py predict --model hybrid

# 4. Predict for specific appraisals
python run.py predict --index 0
python run.py predict --index 25
```

### Example Output

```
Appraisal #0
Subject: 142-950 Oakview Ave Kingston ON K7M 6W8
Available properties: 146
