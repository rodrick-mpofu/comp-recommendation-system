# Milestone 2: Explainability - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Milestone 2 has been successfully implemented! The system now provides comprehensive natural language explanations for comp recommendations, helping users understand WHY properties are recommended and HOW they compare to the subject.

## What Was Built

### 1. CompExplainer Module
**File**: [src/models/explainer.py](src/models/explainer.py) (~400 lines)

A complete explainability engine that generates human-readable explanations for:

#### A. Single Recommendation Explanations
Explains why a specific property was recommended:
- **Key Similarities** - What matches the subject
- **Notable Differences** - What differs significantly
- **Price Information** - Sale price context
- **Overall Assessment** - Quality rating based on score

#### B. Comparative Analysis
Compares two properties to explain ranking:
- Why property A scores higher than property B
- Key factors driving the difference
- Side-by-side metric comparison

#### C. Rejection Explanations
Explains why a property was NOT selected:
- Main issues preventing selection
- Specific metric mismatches
- Guidance on what would make it acceptable

#### D. Summary Generation
Overall summary of all recommendations:
- Subject property overview
- Top N recommendations with key metrics
- Quick reference table

### 2. Explanation Features

**Similarity Detection:**
- ✅ **GLA (Square Footage)**
  - Very similar: < 10% difference
  - Similar: 10-20% difference
  - Shows exact values and percentages

- ✅ **Bedrooms**
  - Exact match highlighted
  - Similar (+/- 1 bedroom)
  - Large gaps flagged

- ✅ **Property Type**
  - Must match for strong similarity
  - Detached, Townhouse, Condo, etc.
  - Critical for accurate comparisons

- ✅ **Age**
  - Similar: < 5 years difference
  - Moderate: 5-10 years
  - Large gaps: 10+ years flagged

- ✅ **Stories**
  - 1-story, 2-story, 3-story matching
  - Structural similarity indicator

- ✅ **Proximity** (when available)
  - Very close: < 0.5 km
  - Close: < 2 km
  - Distance shown in kilometers

**Difference Highlighting:**
- Size mismatches >= 20%
- Bedroom differences >= 2
- Age differences >= 10 years
- Property type mismatches
- All shown with direction (larger/smaller, newer/older)

**Assessment Levels:**
| Score | Assessment | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| >= 0.7 | Excellent | Highly similar across key metrics |
| 0.5-0.7 | Good | Strong similarities, minor differences |
| 0.3-0.5 | Acceptable | Moderate similarities |
| < 0.3 | Fair | Some key differences to consider |

### 3. Integration

**CLI Integration:**
```bash
# Basic usage
python run.py predict --explain

# With specific appraisal
python run.py predict --index 5 --explain

# With specific model
python run.py predict --model knn --explain
```

**Programmatic Usage:**
```python
from models.explainer import CompExplainer

explainer = CompExplainer()

# Explain single recommendation
explanation = explainer.explain_recommendation(
    subject_property, recommended_property, score, rank
)

# Compare two properties
comparison = explainer.explain_comparison(
    subject, prop_a, prop_b, score_a, score_b
)

# Explain rejection
why_not = explainer.explain_why_not_selected(
    subject, rejected_property, low_score
)
```

### 4. Example Output

```
1. Unit 206 - 835 Milford Drive
   Score: 0.3421
   GLA: 950 | Beds: 2 | Price: $315,000

Recommendation #1: Unit 206 - 835 Milford Drive
Recommendation Score: 0.342

KEY SIMILARITIES:
  + Very similar size (950.0 vs 1044.0 sq ft, 9.0% difference)
  + Same property type (Townhouse)

NOTABLE DIFFERENCES:
  - Bedroom count differs by 2

Sale Price: $315,000

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
  Acceptable comparable - moderate similarities
```

## Technical Architecture

```

### Rule-Based Engine

Currently uses **rule-based explanations** with clear thresholds:

```python
# GLA similarity
gla_diff_pct = abs(comp_gla - subject_gla) / subject_gla * 100
if gla_diff_pct < 10:
    similarity = "Very similar size"
elif gla_diff_pct < 20:
    similarity = "Similar size"
```

### LLM-Ready Architecture

Designed for easy LLM integration:

```python
class CompExplainer:
    def __init__(self, use_llm=False, llm_api_key=None):
        # Currently uses rule-based
        # Future: Switch to LLM-based

    def _explain_with_llm(self, subject, comp, score, rank):
        # Placeholder for GPT-4, Claude, etc.
        # Will provide more nuanced explanations
```

**Future LLM Integration Benefits:**
- More natural language
- Context-aware phrasing
- Market insights
- Comparative market analysis
- Fine-tuning with reinforcement learning

- Understand the scoring system
- Verify recommendations make sense
- Catch potential errors

### 3. Validation

- Check if similarities are real
- Identify if differences matter
- Confirm property type matches

### 4. Learning

- Size similarity is critical (GLA most important)
- Property type must match
- Age similarity matters
- Bedroom count is significant

## Testing Results
